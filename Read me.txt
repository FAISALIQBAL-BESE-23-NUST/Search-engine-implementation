Download the dataset from the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fabiochiusano/medium-articles

When you have downloaded the dataset, if it is a zip/compressed file, unzip it.
Then run the the cleaning(Make chunks of dataset).py file.
contact @Ali, if the files doesn't run.

Now run the lexicon file, and then the forward index file.
The forward index file is giving an error, which is that the first chunk of forward index, is processed on the
10th dataset chunk, and the inverse happens for the 10th one. Else are correct.

To correct this run the chunkOneAndTenForwardIndex.py file.

Now run the inverted index file.
